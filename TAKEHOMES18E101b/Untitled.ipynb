    "Many observers project that by the end of the twenty-first century the population of the United States will be stable. Using the Solow growth model, what would such a downward shift in the growth rate of the labor force do to the growth of output per worker and to the growth of total output if zero labor force growth came suddenly and permanently in 2050? Consider both the effect on the balanced-growth equilibrium path and the transition from the “old” positive population growth to the “new” zero population growth balanced-growth path.\n",
