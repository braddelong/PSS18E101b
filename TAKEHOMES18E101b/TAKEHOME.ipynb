That code cell performs a regression analysis: if consumption spending C is a simple linear function of GDP—national income—Y of the form $ C = a + bY + \\epsilon $, where $ \\epsilon $ are a host of additional variables not predictable from Y, what are the most likely values of the coefficients a and b, and how good a job do those coefficients and that function do at capturing the determinants of C?\n",
    "3. The regression analysis tells us that the estimated value of the slope coefficient b from the regression of consumption spending C on income Y is 0.6607. What is the relationship between this coefficient and the MPC—the parameter $ c_y $ in our simple flexprice business cycle model? Assume that the tax rate t in the simple model is 0.25. In the code cell further below \"Task F answers\", set the variable c_y equal to your estimate of what the value of b tells us that the MPC is. "

    "Task F produced a very high estimate of the marginal propensity to consume, MPC, $ c_y $. It seemed to indicate that households do not smooth spending very much at all—that they take virtually all of a change in their income and spend it. This estimate was obtained because the overwhelming bulk of the identifying variance in the regression analysis of Task F consisted of permanent, long run changes in actual and expected income. Now let us look at shorter run, more temporary changes. We do this by performing a regression analysis in which the dependent and independent variables are not the simple levels of consumption spending C and national income Y, but rather one year changes in those variables scaled by the then-current level of real national income.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the code cell below \"Calculating one year changes\", which calculates and then plots one year changes in consumption spending C and national income Y, both of them as fractions of the then-current level of national income Y. Examine the plot. Email me at delong@econ.berkeley.edu with the subject line \"Econ 101b S2018 PS8: Delta_C and Delta_Y DO Not Look Right\" if anything looks wrong to you.\n",
    "2. Run the code cell further below \"1 year changes regression: full sample\". Use the estimated b coefficient—the number immediately to the right of the \"Delta_Y\" under the heading \"coef\"—to calculate the estimate of the MPC $ c_y $ produced from examining one year changes. Assume once again that the tax rate t is 0.25. In the code cell \"Task G answers\", set the variable c_y_1_year equal to the estimate of the MPC.\n",
    "3. Duplicate the code cell \"Calculating one year changes\". Then paste it immediately below. Alter the first line of the pasted version to read \"# Calculating one year changes: earlier half of the sample\"\n",
    "4. Change the code in \"# Calculating one year changes: earlier half of the sample\" so that it runs the regression analysis for 1 year changes for only the first half of our 280 observation-long post-WWII data. In the code cell \"Task G answers\", set the variable c_y_1_year_early_sample equal to the estimate of the MPC for the first half of the sample.\n",

    "Task F produced a very high estimate of the marginal propensity to consume out of disposable income, MPC, $ c_y $, indicating that households do not smooth spending very much at all—that they take virtually all of a change in their income and spend it. This estimate captures the MPC in response to permanent, long run changes in actual and expected income. But the MPC that is relevant for business cycle analysis is a short run MPC: the response of consumption to surprise, transitory changes in national income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task G produed somewhat smaller estimates of the MPC by looking at the reaction of consumption spending to one-year changes in national income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us look at one quarter changes. We do this by performing a regression analysis in which the dependent and independent variables are oen quarter changes in those variables scaled by the then-current level of real national income.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the code cell below \"Calculating one quarter changes\", which calculates and then plots one year changes in consumption spending C and national income Y, both of them as fractions of the then-current level of national income Y. Examine the plot. Email me at delong@econ.berkeley.edu with the subject line \"Econ 101b S2018 PS8: Delta_C and Delta_Y DO Not Look Right\" if anything looks wrong to you.\n",
    "2. Run the code cell further below \"1 quarter changes regression: full sample\". Use the estimated b coefficient—the number immediately to the right of the \"Delta_Y\" under the heading \"coef\"—to calculate the estimate of the MPC $ c_y $ produced from examining one year changes. Assume once again that the tax rate t is 0.25. In the code cell \"Task G answers\", set the variable c_y_1_quarter equal to the estimate of the MPC.\n",
    "3. Duplicate the code cell \"Calculating one quarter changes\". Then paste it immediately below. Alter the first line of the pasted version to read \"# Calculating one quarter changes: earlier half of the sample\"\n",
    "4. Change the code in \"# Calculating one quarter changes: earlier half of the sample\" so that it runs the regression analysis for 1 year changes for only the first half of our 280 observation-long post-WWII data. In the code cell \"Task G answers\", set the variable c_y_1_quarter_early_sample equal to the estimate of the MPC for the first half of the sample.\n",
    "5. Duplicate the code cell \"Calculating one quarter changes\". Then paste it immediately below. Alter the first line of the pasted version to read \"# Calculating one quarter changes: later half of the sample\"\n",
