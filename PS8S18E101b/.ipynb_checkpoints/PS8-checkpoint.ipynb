    "The autograder, both in the tests you run along the way as you work on the problem set and in calculating the final score, looks in the same directory as the problem set notebook for an \"ok.tests\" directory, and then runs the tests in the \"q\\*\\*.py\" files in that directory (where \"\\*\\*\" denotes a two-digit number, possibly with a leading zero). Those tests take the form of comparing a variable that should be in your namespace and seeing if it is close to some desired value that we get when we do the problem set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus while the problem set instructions ask you to run simulations and plot graphs, what you are tested on is whether the appropriate variables in your namespace have (close to the) right values. We do not care what code you use in order to get those variables to the right values. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can run simulations and then pick appropriate values out by slicing a series in order to get the right number. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use your knowledge of the algebraic solution to the model to have Python calculate the answer, having first set the parameters to the right values, as in:\n",

    "    KoverYalternative = s/(n+Delta_n+g+delta)\n",

    "    KoverYalternative = 4.8\n",
    "    \n",

But: _ars longa, vita brevis_. Focus on what works _for you_: the key is to get a sense of how economists' center-of-gravity analyses of long-run growth work, so that when you encounter such an analysis later, outside the university, you have the right intellectual panoply to evaluate it.\n",

    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Do** exercise agile development practices: if there is a line of code that you have not tested, test it. The best way to test is to ask the machine to echo back to you the thing you have just created in its namespace to make sure that it is what you want it to be. Only after you are **certain** that your namespace contains what you think it does should you write the next line of code. And then you should immediately test it...   \n",

If there is not, you should be assignment a variable in your namespace to a value. **Do** curse the mathematicians 500 years ago who did not realize that in the twenty-first century it would be very convenient if we had different and not confusable symbols for equals-as-assignment and equals-as-test...   \n",

Now let us look at shorter run, more temporary changes.

    "Task F produced a very high estimate of the marginal propensity to consume out of disposable income, MPC, $ c_y $, indicating that households do not smooth spending very much at all—that they take virtually all of a change in their income and spend it. This estimate captures the MPC in response to permanent, long run changes in actual and expected income. But the MPC that is relevant for business cycle analysis is a short run MPC: the response of consumption to surprise, transitory changes in national income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task G produed somewhat smaller estimates of the MPC by looking at the reaction of consumption spending to one-year changes in national income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us look at one quarter changes. We do this by performing a regression analysis in which the dependent and independent variables are oen quarter changes in those variables scaled by the then-current level of real national income.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the code cell below \"Calculating one quarter changes\", which calculates and then plots one year changes in consumption spending C and national income Y, both of them as fractions of the then-current level of national income Y. Examine the plot. Email me at delong@econ.berkeley.edu with the subject line \"Econ 101b S2018 PS8: Delta_C and Delta_Y DO Not Look Right\" if anything looks wrong to you.\n",
    "2. Run the code cell further below \"1 quarter changes regression: full sample\". Use the estimated b coefficient—the number immediately to the right of the \"Delta_Y\" under the heading \"coef\"—to calculate the estimate of the MPC $ c_y $ produced from examining one year changes. Assume once again that the tax rate t is 0.25. In the code cell \"Task G answers\", set the variable c_y_1_quarter equal to the estimate of the MPC.\n",
    "3. Duplicate the code cell \"Calculating one quarter changes\". Then paste it immediately below. Alter the first line of the pasted version to read \"# Calculating one quarter changes: earlier half of the sample\"\n",
    "4. Change the code in \"# Calculating one quarter changes: earlier half of the sample\" so that it runs the regression analysis for 1 year changes for only the first half of our 280 observation-long post-WWII data. In the code cell \"Task G answers\", set the variable c_y_1_quarter_early_sample equal to the estimate of the MPC for the first half of the sample.\n",
    "5. Duplicate the code cell \"Calculating one quarter changes\". Then paste it immediately below. Alter the first line of the pasted version to read \"# Calculating one quarter changes: later half of the sample\"\n",
    "6. Change the code in \"# Calculating one quarter changes: later half of the sample\" so that it runs the regression analysis for 1 year changes for only the seconc half of our 280 observation-long post-WWII data. In the code cell \"Task G answers\", set the variable c_y_1_quarter_late_sample equal to the estimate of the MPC for the second half of the sample."
